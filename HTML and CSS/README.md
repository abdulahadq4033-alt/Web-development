My Learning Journey in HTML and CSS &#9992;

My learning journey in HTML and CSS has been both exciting and rewarding. I began by understanding the fundamentals of HTML, learning how to structure web pages using elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and forms. This helped me realize how HTML acts as the backbone of a website by organizing content in a meaningful and accessible way.

As I progressed, I moved on to CSS, where I learned how to style and design web pages. I explored concepts such as colors, fonts, borders, margins, padding, and layouts. Using CSS, I learned how to make web pages visually appealing and user-friendly. I also gained knowledge of box models, positioning, flexbox, and responsive design, which allowed me to create layouts that adapt well to different screen sizes.

Through practice and experimentation, I started combining HTML and CSS to build complete web pages. I focused on writing clean, well-structured code and following best practices to improve readability and maintainability. Each project helped me gain confidence and sharpen my problem-solving skills.

Overall, learning HTML and CSS has given me a strong foundation in web development. It has helped me understand how websites are built from scratch and has motivated me to continue learning advanced web technologies to create more interactive and dynamic websites in the future.
