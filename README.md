# Web Development (Full Stack Developer) Journey

## 📌 Overview

This document represents my **Full Stack Web Development learning journey**. It combines both **frontend** and **backend** roadmaps, clearly showing what I have achieved so far and what I aim to learn in the future. This README will be updated as I grow and gain hands-on experience.

---

## ✅ What I Have Achieved So Far

### 🌐 Frontend Development

#### HTML

* Learned how to structure web pages using HTML
* Understood semantic tags and proper document structure
* Built basic web page layouts

#### CSS

* Learned how to style web pages using CSS
* Worked with colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts
* Understood how CSS improves user experience and design

➡️ **Current status:** I have achieved a foundational understanding of **HTML and CSS**.

## 🧠 Understanding Full Stack Development

A **Full Stack Developer** works on both:

* **Frontend** – What users see and interact with
* **Backend** – Server logic, databases, and APIs

Full stack development involves connecting the frontend with the backend to build complete, functional, and scalable web applications.

## 🚀 What I Plan to Learn Next

## 🔹 Frontend Roadmap

### Core Technologies

1. **HTML** – Advanced semantics and accessibility
2. **CSS** – Responsive design, Flexbox, Grid, and animations
3. **JavaScript** – Core concepts, DOM manipulation, and async programming

### Advanced Frontend Tools

* **TypeScript** – Safer and scalable JavaScript
* **React** – UI toolkit for building component-based interfaces
* **SASS** – CSS preprocessor for maintainable styles
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework

### Testing & Frameworks

* **Automated Testing** – Jest, Vitest
* **Meta-Frameworks** – Next.js (primary), Remix

## 🔹 Backend Roadmap

### Programming Languages

**Primary Backend Stack:**

* **JavaScript (Node.js)**
* **TypeScript**

**Future Language Goals:**

* **Python** – Backend development, APIs, automation
* **Java** – Enterprise-level backend systems
* **C++** – Performance-oriented and system-level understanding

### Backend Frameworks

* **Express.js** – Lightweight Node.js framework
* **NestJS** – Scalable and structured backend framework (future)

### Databases

* SQL: PostgreSQL / MySQL
* NoSQL: MongoDB
* Database design and relationships

### APIs & Server Concepts

* RESTful APIs
* HTTP methods and request/response lifecycle
* JSON data handling

### Authentication & Security

* User authentication and authorization
* Password hashing
* JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

### Tools & Practices

* **Git** – Version control
* Environment variables
* Basic deployment concepts

### Backend Testing

* Unit testing
* Integration testing
