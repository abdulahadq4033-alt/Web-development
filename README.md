## ✅ What I Have Achieved So Far

So far, I have focused on building a **strong foundation in the core building blocks of the web**.

### 🔹 HTML

* Learned how to structure web pages using HTML
* Understood semantic tags and their importance
* Built basic web page layouts

### 🔹 CSS

* Learned how to style web pages using CSS
* Worked with colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts
* Understood the role of CSS in making websites visually appealing

At this stage, my knowledge is limited to **HTML and CSS**, and I am intentionally building a strong base before moving forward.
